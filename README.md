# ESLint plugin Angular template `use-track-by` or aliases

If you are using the awesome `@angular-eslint` plugin and especialy the rule `use-track-by-function`,
you will see that there is no possibility to custom this rule (link to rule configuration). Only params of criticy is allowed ('error', 'warn', ...)

This plugin is just a duplication of the existing rule but adding customisation with aliases âœ¨
